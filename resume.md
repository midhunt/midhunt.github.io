### SUMMARY
Data science professional close to 7 years of experience in data warehousing, analytics, specializing in statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis, data mining and machine learning using open source tools for analysis. Interested in Data Mining, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.  

### EXPERIENCE
**Data Science Lead, Wicked Ride Adventure Services Pvt Ltd.(Bounce)** <span style="float: right; ">Mar, 2020 - Feb, 2021</span>  
_Layout a roadmap for Zuink & EV Data Sciences. Plan on infrastructure for real-time analytics and alerts. Build models & tools to optimize the battery-swapping network, usage of batteries and improve the calendar life of the batteries in turn optimize the usage of EV without affecting the vehicle performance._
* ```Network Optimization```
Identified locations of new kirana partners to tie up along with the existing partners for battery swapping stations (BSS) using clustering algorithms. Built a network optimization tool called Bridgeman. _R_
* ```Get Me a Battery (GMAB)```
Built an algorithm to allocate multiple batteries to the agent from their location and based on the
availability of swapping station & charged batteries at BSS. _Python_
* ```EV Mileage Analysis```
Built a dashboard on Metabase to capture weekly EV mileage metrics and analyzed the drop in EV mileage to understand the performance of batteries and EVs. _SQL, Metabase_
* ```Controller Update A/B Testing```
Analyzed the impact of motor controller update & regenerative braking on mileage and performance
of the vehicle and gave the necessary recommendations. _R_

**Senior Data Analyst, Ather Energy Pvt Ltd.** <span style="float: right; ">Feb, 2019 - Mar, 2020</span>  
_Explore and understand the engineering sub-systems of an electric scooter. Build smart features for scooters, develop tools and support internal stakeholders with data analysis, help them make better decisions, and build intelligent scooters._  

* ```Health Metrics```  
Designed and built ETL pipeline using Airflow for various use cases. Built metrics to evaluate the performance and health of scooter subsystems. Explored various enterprise and open source tools for dashboards. Created dashboards for visualizing the metrics. _Apache Airflow, SQL, Python, BigQuery, Tableau_
* ```Charging and Ather Grid Analysis```  
Analyzed the customers’ charging behavior to optimize battery, charger, and public charging POD
performance. SQL, Python. _SQL, Python_   


**Data Analyst, Ather Energy Pvt Ltd.** <span style="float: right; ">Jan, 2016 - Feb, 2019</span>  
_Explore and understand the engineering sub-systems of an electric scooter. Build smart features for scooters, develop tools and support internal stakeholders with data analysis, help them make better decisions, and build intelligent scooters._  
* ```Trip Identification and Trip History```  
Developed an algorithm to identify riding and charging sessions. Built an application to
calculate ride statistics for the Ather mobile app. Created a pipeline for deploying the application on Elastic Beanstalk using CI/CD. _SQL, Python_
* ```Make Every Scooter Smart and Intelligent (MESSI)```
Built data pipeline from DAQ for ICE scooters. Created a dashboard on GCP for validating, analyzing the ride data. _R, Shiny_


**Associate Data Analyst, Graymatter Software Services Pvt Ltd.** <span style="float: right; ">Mar, 2015 - Jan, 2016</span>  
_Explore insurance domain. Build and test hypothesis and develop models using statistical methods and
machine learning algorithms and deploy the models into the product._  
* ```Customer Segmentation and Cross Selling```  
Clustered customers based on their explicit and implicit behavior to cross sell insurance products. Worked on customer market segmentation using clustering algorithms. _R, SQL_
* ```Motor Insurance Fraud Claim Detection```  
Built fraud detection model based on the customer vehicle profile, behavior profile and demographic behavior using classification techniques. Improved the model accuracy using tree based methods. _R, SQL_
* ```Graymatter IA+```  
Designed product for Cross-sell and Up-sell which includes data extraction, selection, rule engine recommendation and model based recommendation, monitoring and recalibrating the models. R


**Associate Consultant, Nextwave Data Sciences** <span style="float: right; ">Jul, 2014 - Mar, 2015</span>  
_Build POCs using open source tools for analysis_  
* ```Price Comparison of Crude Oil vs retail market in India```  
Analyzed drop in crude oil prices in comparison with Indian retail market and the effect of deregulation of fuel prices in India. Collected the data by web-scraping using python beautiful-soup. _R, Python_
